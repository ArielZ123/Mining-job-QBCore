***Hi good to see you again :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:, I am here with a new release for you guys but before i start let me thank two people:***

***@dividerz, thank you for the help with a small part of the code mate :wink:.***

***@M0SK4 Thank you for the help with the script tests💻.***

***[📕]About the job: you have two mining zones, one is for stones and the other is for rocks (in the mine shaft location) when the rocks value is the higher then the stones.***
***You have to get 15 stones / rocks to smelt them and then go to sell a pack of your smelted stones / rocks.***

***[📕]Script Features:***
***1) Mining effect - when hitting a stone / rock.***
***2) The mine shaft in open until the night(23:00).***
***3) You need to have a pickaxe as an item to be able to mine.***
***4) sound when hitting a stone / rock.***
***5) Coming soon - HP losing in the mine shaft while mining.***
***If you have any ideas you can suggest here!.***

***[📕]Script Settings:***
***Config.Lua - > will give you the option to switch between the old esx to the new one (esx legacy).***
***If you are using the esx legacy version please set the config to false and do the following thing:***
***Go to -> fxmanifest.lua - > then go to -> shared_scripts and then add this line -> '@es_extended/imports.lua' under -> 'main/config.lua'.***

***For the other things that you can do i left for you in the client side and the server side, several guidance instructions that can help you.***
***If you still have any problems leave me a message.***

***[📕]Script Dependencies:***
***I placed over the mine shaft some stones props by codewalker so you need to download the ymap file from here:***
