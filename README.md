Hi good to see you again :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:, I am here with a new release for you guys but before i start let me thank two people:

@dividerz, thank you for the help with a small part of the code mate :wink:.

@M0SK4 Thank you for the help with the script testsüíª.

[üìï]About the job: you have two mining zones, one is for stones and the other is for rocks (in the mine shaft location) when the rocks value is the higher then the stones.
You have to get 15 stones / rocks to smelt them and then go to sell a pack of your smelted stones / rocks.

[üìï]Script Features:
1) Mining effect - when hitting a stone / rock.
2) The mine shaft in open until the night(23:00).
3) You need to have a pickaxe as an item to be able to mine.
4) sound when hitting a stone / rock.
5) Coming soon - HP losing in the mine shaft while mining.
If you have any ideas you can suggest here!.

[üìï]Script Settings:
things that you can do: I left for you in the client side and the server side, several guidance instructions that can help you.
If you still have any problems leave me a message.

[üìï]Script Dependencies:
I placed over the mine shaft some stones props by codewalker so you need to download the ymap file from here:

https://github.com/ArielZ123/Rocks

üì£Sound system:
You need (Interact Sound) due to the sound effect:

> https://github.com/plunkettscott/interact-sound

You can use the sound file from the sound folder, and if you have a different sound system so go and do it as your system.



**> ‚ùóÔ∏èDONT FORGET TO LOAD THE ITEMS TO YOUR DB, PLEASE ADD YOUR DB NAME HERE: USE `DBNAME`; IN THE SQL FILE‚ùóÔ∏è.**
